**pyproxy Ansible** is an Ansible role for deploying the [pyproxy](https://github.com/pyproxytools/pyproxy) project.

## ‚ö° **Deployment Methods**

| Feature              | Supported |
| -------------------- | --------- |
| From source          | ‚úÖ        |
| Using package        | ‚úÖ        |
| Using Docker run     | ‚úÖ        |
| Using Docker Compose | ‚úÖ        |

## üì¶ **Installation**

You can add the role to your playbook as a submodule. For example:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/pyproxytools/pyproxy-ansible roles/pyproxy
```

## üîß **Configuration**

By default, the installation method uses Docker Compose.
You can change the installation method and adjust other settings in the `./defaults/main.yml` file, either directly or by overriding variables in your playbook.

### üîê **SSL Certificate Handling**

If you want to provide your own SSL inspection certificates, you can configure the role to copy them to the target machine.

* Set the variable `pyproxy."method".ssl_inspect_ca_folder` to the **path of the folder** containing your certificates (e.g. `certs/`).
* The expected files inside this folder are typically `cert.pem` and `key.pem` or a custom CA used by pyproxy.
* These files will be copied to `{{ pyproxy."method".install_path }}/certs/ca`.

For example for the docker method here are some variables :
```yaml
pyproxy:
  docker:
    ssl_inspect_ca_folder: "certs/"
    volumes:
      - source: /opt/pyproxy/certs/ca
        target: /app/certs/ca
        type: folder
```
Don't forget to add the CA volume for the "compose" and "docker" methods.

‚ö†Ô∏è If the variable `pyproxy.docker.ssl_inspect_ca_folder` is **not defined**, the certificate copy step is skipped automatically.

> The path is resolved relative to the role or playbook. Make sure the folder exists and is accessible during the playbook run.
